# CS50 Final Project
  This is the **ARCH ProjectLAB**, a website programmed in HTML with Python, SQL and JavaScript and stylized with CSS in order to facilitate the preconception of the architectural project, a stage where the design variables are defined, how they should materialize in space, under what guidelines and what needs

## How to begin?
  The program is based on an intuitive, friendly interface with simple functionality: just register, create your new project and start editing it. You can also develop several projects simultaneously by switching the editing tabs through your Portfolio. To do this, after registering and logging in, go to the _**New Projects**_ guide and create your project filling out the datasheet. Then, the workspace is open! And now things start to get interesting.

## How can i use the workspace?
  The editing tab, or workspace, works with three menus:
  - The first is the **Needs program**: where it is possible to define the sectorization of the architectural project and the content of each sector. 
  - The second is the **Architectural program**: where the values that must be incorporated into the architectural project are defined in different scopes. To better understand this subject, i recommend reading the book "The Design Process in Architecture: from Theory to Technology", as well as this [article](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287554488_Understanding_school_design_processes) (in English). 
  - The third and last menu is the **Qualification**: who allows us interpret the value of the pre-conceived solutions to the architectural project, requiring an answer to a series of topics that according to the _Center for Climate, Health and Environment of the Harvard School of Health_, make it a good building for human health. See more at: [forhealth.org](https://forhealth.org/).<br/>
  
  Finally, it is worth noting that the editing of the topics is instantaneous: just click on the previous text and modify it, making the pre-conception stage of the project simple, quick and well structured.
  
**P.S.** The workspace is not a guide, so you cannot open it without creating a new project or editing any other one through your Portfolio.

_Thanks for reading, I hope you like it._
